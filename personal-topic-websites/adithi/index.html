    <h2><u>Bacteria</u></h2>
    <p>Bacteria is generally catogrized into two types: probiotic and pathogenic. Probiotic bacteria, also known as good bacteria, is naturaly found in our body and help it function. One example is the bacteria found in your guts. Pathogenic bacteria does the complete opposite and is harmful for the body but can usually be treated with antibiotics. In this website you will learn of the different types of bacteria and their structures. In these there are multiple different structures they are found in and variety of ways they work.</p><center>

   <hr> <h2><u>Viruses</u></h2>
    <p>Similar to bacteria viruses can be good or bad. Viruses are catogrized based on the way they can duplicate their gentic information and their shape. Viruses are not completly considered living orgnisms because while they have many similarities to living organisms, they do not maintain homeostasis and can not duplicate gentic information alone. These two processes must be present for an organism to be considered living.    </p>
